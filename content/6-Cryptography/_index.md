**Cryptography** is the art of ciphering and deciphering a message. It is the practice of coding information to ensure only the person that a message was written for can read and process the information.

As illustrated in the image, `plaintext` and a `key` are provided to a `cipher`, resulting in ciphered text.

The key is a special argument passed to the cipher along with the plaintext. The cipher uses the key to make decisions about how to implement its cipher algorithm.

Cryptography remains important to protecting data and users, ensuring confidentiality, and preventing cyber criminals from intercepting sensitive corporate information.

And that’s the end of week 2.
